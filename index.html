                 <span> eSports (also known as electronic sports, esports, e-sports, competitive (video) gaming, professional (video) gaming, or pro gaming)
                      are a form of competition that is facilitated by electronic systems, particularly video games;
                       the input of players and teams as well as the output of the eSports system are mediated by human-computer interfaces.
                       Most commonly, eSports take the form of organized, multiplayer video game competitions, particularly between professional players. 
                       The most common video game genres associated with eSports are real-time strategy, fighting, first-person shooter (FPS), and multiplayer online 
                       battle arena (MOBA). Tournaments such as The International, the League of Legends World Championship, the Battle.net World Championship Series, 
                       the Evolution Championship Series, and the Intel Extreme Masters provide live broadcasts of the competition, and prize money and salaries to competitors.
