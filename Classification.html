                 <p> Labeling video games as sports is a controversial point of debate. While some point to the growth in popularity of eSports 
                     as justification for designating some games as sports, others contend that video games will never reach the status of "true sports". However popularity is not the only reason identified: some have argued that "careful planning, precise timing, a
                     nd skillful execution" ought to be what classifies an activity as sport, and that physical exertion and outdoor playing areas are not required by all traditional or non-traditional 'sports'. In a 2014 technology conference, when asked about the recent buyout of popular game streaming service Twitch, ESPN president John Skipper described eSports as "not a sport â€“ [they're] a competition." In 2013 on an episode of Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel the panelist openly laughed at the topic.[59] In addition, many in the fighting games community maintain a distinction between their competitive gaming competitions and the more commercially connected eSports competitions of other genres.[60] Video games are sometimes classified as a mind sport.[61] In the 2015 eSports World Championship hosted by the International e-Sports Federation, an eSports panel was hosted with guests from international sports society to discuss the future recognition of eSports as a recognized, legitimate sporting activity worldwide.[62]
In 2013, Canadian League of Legends player Danny "Shiphtur" Le became the first pro gamer to receive a United States P-1A visa, a category designated for "Internationally Recognized Athletes".
In 2016, the French government started working on a project to regulate and recognize eSports.
The 2007 Asian Indoor Games was the first notable multi-sport competition including eSports as an official medal-winning event alongside other traditional sports, and the later editions of the Asian Indoor Games and its successor the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games have always included eSports as an official medal event or an exhibition event up to now. Moreover, the Asian Games, which is the Asian top-level multi-sport competition, will also include eSports as an medal event
 at the 2022 edition; eSports will be presented as an exhibition event at the 2018 Asian Games as a lead-in to the 2022 games.
